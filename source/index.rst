Mental-Health-Support
=====================

This project aims to create a therapy chatbot that provides mental health support by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The chatbot combines conversational AI with a document parsing pipeline to retrieve relevant knowledge from psychological concepts and respond empathetically to user queries. The system integrates a vector database for efficient data retrieval and supports both text and audio inputs for user interaction.
